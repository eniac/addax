### How to build
```
cmake . -B build
cd build
make -j
```

### Prerequisite before running
+ Follow the instructions of [README.md](../tools/README.md) in
  [tools](../tools/) to generate the materials for evluations of 
  non-interactive and interactive variants.

### How to run

#### Non-interactive local auction
+ Run `./auction-non-interactive -a AD-NUM -s FILE-SHARE1 -S FILE-SHARE2 -d
   DIR-OF-SHARES/ -t NUMBER-OF-RUN`.
   + `FILE-SHARE1` and `FILE-SHARE2` is the file that contains all file names of
     the generated share 1 or share 2 individually (e.g., the file with suffix
     `s1-idx` or `s2-idx` generated by the script in [tools](../tools/)).
   + `DIR-OF-SHARES` is the directory that contains these generated share files.

#### Interactive local auction
+ Run `./auction-interactive -a AD-NUM -s FILE-SHARE1-DIR -S FILE-SHARE2-DIR -d
   DIR-OF-SHARES/ -t NUMBER-OF-RUN -r ROUND`.
   + `FILE-SHARE1-DIR` and `FILE-SHARE1-DIR` is the directory with  that contains all file names of
     the generated share 1 or share 2 individually (e.g., the directory with
     suffix `interactive-idx` generated by the script in [tools](../tools/)).
   + `DIR-OF-SHARES` is the directory that contains these generated share files.
